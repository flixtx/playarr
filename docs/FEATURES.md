## Core Features

- Fetches movies and TV shows from AGTV (M3U8) and Xtream Codec providers
- Disk caching for efficient data retrieval with configurable expiration policies (TTL values defined in provider classes)
- Automatic update detection for TV shows (Xtream)
- All data stored in MongoDB for efficient querying and scalability
- Supports provider-specific cleanup rules and ignore patterns
- Respects provider priority and enabled status
- Native EngineScheduler orchestrates recurring jobs defined in `web-api/src/jobs.json`:
  - IPTV provider sync runs on startup (after a short delay) and then every 6 hours
  - Live TV synchronization runs on startup and then every 12 hours
  - Post-execution chains (like `providerTitlesMonitor`) trigger automatically after dependent jobs
